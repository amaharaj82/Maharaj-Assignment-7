  1. Create a a function that accepts (1) a quantitative response variable, (2) a quantitative explanatory variable, and (3) a number. Suppose we denote the response variable as y, the explanatory variable as x, and the number as p. Your function should model y as a linear function of x and then for each (x,y) pair determine if hte residual is one of the p largest in the set of residuals, with largest defined in terms of absolute value (e.g., a residual of -10 is just as large as a residual of 10). The function should return a logical vector indicating TRUE for each pair that has one of the pth largest residuals and FALSE otherwise. 

```{r}

```

2. Obtain a real data set with quantitative response and explanatory variales (n>=50). Plot these scatterplot with a regression line. Use your function to help you highlight the 10% largest residuals on the scatterplot. 
```{r}


```
